I have used Django for this task and have used the Django auth app for handling the authentication.

#### Steps to use the demo

1. Create an admin account by running "python3 manage.py createsuperuser" command.
2. Run the Django server locally.
3. Login using the admin credentials(127.0.0.1:8000/login). There you will be able to create users.
4. After creating users, you will be able to login using admin or user credentials and the redirection will be done accordingly.
